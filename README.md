# Meal Master
This service is inspired by lack of food recommendations for gym enjoyers. It is very easy to get bored with same food everyday, so I am trying to create a helpful website that assists you in reaching your fitness goals!

## Initial Plan
Here are the feature that are gonna be implemented in the beginning of development:

### Daily Calorie & Macronutrient Calucaltor
After entetring basic information, like: weight goals, training intensity and more, user receives insights on daily calorie intake and micronutrients for the day (protein, carbs, fats).

### Nutrition facts & Recommendations
After receiving recommended plan the user gets examples of different products to achieve goal (high protein food for muscle gain, low fat food for gain loss, etc.).

### Meal Suggestion
After receiving separate items, user can browse through generated options for differernt meals (breakfast, lunch, snack, on-the-go, etc) based on the feedback of food preferences, provided before.

## Future Goals
Features if everything else is working smooth:

## Recipe Integration
If the user approves recommended dish, the recipe for this dish will be displayed, showing step by step tutorial how to cook selected meal.

## User Profile
User can enter their information in their profile to track their progress, alowing user to save selected meals and recipes.

## Mobile Applications
If the project is successful, it would be great to add mobile application for easier access and greater number of users.

## Stack and Tools
- Frontend with React
- Backend with Django
